	abstract = {We present Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI) – a data collection and policy learning framework that allows direct skill transfer from in-the-wild human demonstrations to deployable robot policies. UMI employs hand-held grippers coupled with careful interface design to enable portable, lowcost, and information-rich data collection for challenging bimanual and dynamic manipulation demonstrations. To facilitate deployable policy learning, UMI incorporates a carefully designed policy interface with inference-time latency matching and a relative-trajectory action representation. The resulting learned policies are hardware-agnostic and deployable across multiple robot platforms. Equipped with these features, UMI framework unlocks new robot manipulation capabilities, allowing zeroshot generalizable dynamic, bimanual, precise, and long-horizon behaviors, by only changing the training data for each task. We demonstrate UMI’s versatility and efficacy with comprehensive real-world experiments, where policies learned via UMI zeroshot generalize to novel environments and objects when trained on diverse human demonstrations. UMI’s hardware and software system is open-sourced at https://umi-gripper.github.io.},
